Insect pests trigger significant losses to food and fiber crops worldwide. If fundamental house health is overlooked, the effects of other types of pest control will be incredibly short-lived as the pests will quickly be back, and in greater numbers.</p>
<p>IPM programs work to monitor for pests and determine them precisely, so that proper control decisions can be made in combination with action limits. However, the major pattern has actually been towards the use of modern-day chemistry and molecular biology to replace standard pesticides with less dangerous chemicals or nontoxic biologically based products; however these methods are still rehabs.</p>
