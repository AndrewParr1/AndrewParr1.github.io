If you reduce your direct exposure and make sure when you enter contact with pesticides, you will lower the opportunity of harming your health. Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last hope. Integrated pest management was conceived throughout the 1950s when insecticide resistance, nontarget results, and economic waste were clearly obvious (Stern et al., 1959).</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential part of an integrated pest management programme. But by concentrating on non-chemical choices first, you can guarantee that your pest management program is efficiently removing pests at the least danger to your food safety program, non-target organisms and the environment.</p>

Inadequate control not only leads to crop losses, however can result in their spread to bigger areas making their control even more hard. Animal and Pest Pest Management has surpassed mine and my communities' expectations.</p>
