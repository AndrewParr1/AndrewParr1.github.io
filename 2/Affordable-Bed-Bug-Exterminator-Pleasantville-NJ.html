Chemical controls were to be used just after regular tracking showed that a pest population had reached a level (the financial threshold) that required treatment to prevent the population from reaching a level (the financial injury level) at which economic losses would go beyond the cost of the control measures.</p>

Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to reduce the need for other, less ecologically beneficial, herbicides.</p>
