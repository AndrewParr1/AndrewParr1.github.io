With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is considered as a cost-efficient and ecologically benign pest control method preferably suited for both small and large farmers worldwide. Once termites have gotten in a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from examination and tracking) are used to make pest control decisions based upon pre-determined management objectives.</p>

Some need long-lasting contracts that cost $400 or more even though for a lot of pests, a single treatment done well ought to be adequate. Once the committee comprehends the types of pests that may get in the structure and potentially damage collection materials, the next action is to set up an IPPM program to resolve the recognized needs.</p>
