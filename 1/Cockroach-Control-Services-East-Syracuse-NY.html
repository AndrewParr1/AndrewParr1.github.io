<p>All countries acknowledged IPM as a preferable technique to pest control even if it was not widely embraced. Pests are a significant danger that damage crops and turn farmers' efforts into a wild-goose chase and resources. Biological insecticides, originated from naturally happening microorganisms (e.g.-- Bt, entomopathogenic fungis and entomopathogenic nematodes ), also fall in this classification.</p>

I have been dealing with Animal & Insect Pest Management for several years; I say "with" due to the fact that it has been a real partnership in servicing the requirements of the communities I handle.
