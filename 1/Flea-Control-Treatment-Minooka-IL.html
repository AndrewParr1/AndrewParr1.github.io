Integrated pest management was conceptualized during the 1950s when insecticide resistance, nontarget results, and economic waste were clearly obvious (Stern et al., 1959).</p>
<p>For example, according to the United States Department of Agriculture-Agricultural Research Service (USDA-ARS 2018 ), IPM is a sustainable, science-based, decision-making procedure that integrates biological, cultural, physical, and chemical tools to identify, manage, and lower danger from pests and pest management tools and techniques in such a way that lessens general financial, health, and ecological dangers.</p>
<p>Pest control is an exceptionally crucial step owing to the fact that a number of pests are providers of damaging disease-causing bacteria. Area-wide pest management was very first promoted for the eradication of a few pests by cumulative efforts (Myers et al., 1998; Smith, 1998; Bowman, 2006).

Biological control is making use of natural enemies-- predators, parasites, rivals, and pathogens-- to control pests and their damage.
