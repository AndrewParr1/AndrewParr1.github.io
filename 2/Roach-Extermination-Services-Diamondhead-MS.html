<p>Action Pest Control provides thorough bed bug control services consisting of evaluations performed by highly trained bed bug pets and bed bug heat treatments administered by professional bed bug specialists. With more regulations on pesticide usage and a decrease in the variety of active ingredients in some crops, there is a greater emphasis on better understanding of readily available control alternatives (Hillocks 2012 ).
