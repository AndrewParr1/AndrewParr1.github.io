<p>1. Chemical Pest Control. Pests can be huge barrier to the development of your business.

Entomopathogenic nematodes can be utilized against particular soil pests, bacteria, and infections versus pests with chewing mouthparts such as Lepidoptera and Coleoptera, while fungi are effective versus a range of pests.</p>
<p>The very first line of defense in IPM is to prevent and suppress insect pest population through nonchemical methods such as cultural practices, usage of resistant ranges, correct watering and fertilization, and natural opponents. IPM thinks about the ecosystem as a whole and takes into account a well balanced mix of the aforementioned control techniques to produce the most effective and least harmful strategy.</p>
