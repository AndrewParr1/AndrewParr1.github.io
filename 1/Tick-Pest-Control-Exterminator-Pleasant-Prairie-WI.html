With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is considered as a cost-efficient and ecologically benign pest control method preferably suited for both small and large farmers worldwide. Once termites have gotten in a structure, they do not restrict themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more.
