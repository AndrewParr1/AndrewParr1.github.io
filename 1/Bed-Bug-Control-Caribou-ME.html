The Indian Pest Control Association (IPCA) is a non-profit trade association of expert pest management companies in India. Chemical control normally describes making use of synthetic chemical pesticides (Pimental 2009 ). Nevertheless, to be technically precise, chemical control must consist of artificial chemicals along with chemicals of botanical or microbial origin.</p>
<p>Chemical insecticides were to be utilized in the way least disruptive to biological control. After handling several nationwide chain exterminators and being mostly dissatisfied with the service, I relied on Terminators for help with pest issues at my place of business. The concept of IPM is to keep an eye on and control pests only when they begin appearing and removing the over application of pesticides in the living environmentWe are well versed with IPM methods, Scope of works, application techniques and industry specific record keeping treatments.</p>
<p>We are Leading Rated Pest Control Company & having lot of customers in these areas. AIPM is owned and run by University graduates who learnt Biology and Pest Management with a focus on Animal Damage Management. Sampling might entail analyzing plants and tape-recording the number of pests or amount of damage observed, or traps might be used to capture the pest species to estimate pest abundance.</p>
<p>Identification of the pest, comprehending its biology and seasonal population patterns, destructive life stages and their habitats, nature of the damage and its economic significance, the vulnerability of each life stage for one or more control alternatives, host preference and alternate hosts, predictability of pest occurrence based on the environment, cropping patterns, farming practices, and other influencing aspects, and all the related details is critical for determining an effective control method. </p>
<p>Normally, the primary aim of IPM programmes is on farming insect pests (IPM Guidelines, 2009 ).
