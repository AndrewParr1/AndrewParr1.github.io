<p>Natural enemies such as predatory arthropods and parasitic wasps can be really efficient in triggering substantial reductions in pest populations in particular scenarios (Hajek and Eilenberg 2018 ). Periodical releases of commercially offered natural enemies or conserving natural opponent populations by providing havens or avoiding practices that damage them are a few of the common practices to control endemic pests.</p>

TAP insulation for attics, wetness barriers for crawl areas, and specially engineered weather stripping for garage and entry doors not only discourage rodents and other devastating pests from going into and living in your house, they're energy effective, too.</p>
