Biological control is a lot easier to implement in a monoculture (single crop) than in a polyculture (several crops).</p>
<p>In Asia, numerous phases of IPM have actually been effectively adopted in Bangladesh (rice), China (cotton, fruit crops, maize, rice, soybean, vegetables), India (cotton, fruit crops, sugarcane, veggies), Indonesia (rice), Korea (rice), Malaysia (vegetables, plantation crops), Pakistan (cotton, mango, sugarcane), Philippine (rice), Tadjikistan (cotton), Thailand (cotton), Turkmenistan (cotton), Vietnam (rice) (Tables 6 and 8, Ooi et al. 1991, Raheja 1995, Morse & Buhler 1997).</p>
