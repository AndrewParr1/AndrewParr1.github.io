<p>This approach describes the use of a range of physical or mechanical strategies for pest exclusion, trapping (sometimes similar to the behavioral control), removal, or destruction (Webb and Linda 1992, Gamliel and Katan 2012, Gogo et al. 2014, Dara et al. 2018 ). Pest exemption with netting or row covers, handpicking or vacuuming to remove pests, mechanical tools for weed control, traps for rodent pests, modifying ecological conditions such as heat or humidity in greenhouses, steam sanitation or solarization, physical or visual bird deterrents such as reflective material or sonic devices are some examples of physical or mechanical control.</p>
<p>Selection of controls for individual pests should be made with the entire crop management system in mind.

A lot of pest control workers work full-time, typically including weekends and evenings. Unexpected result on the end product - extreme usage burns leaves and roots, triggers plant fading, and crops tend to store unsafe amounts of pesticides damaging for consumers.</p>
<p>Combine row covers with crop rotation if you're dealing with pests that overwinter in the soil.
