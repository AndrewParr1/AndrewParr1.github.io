Possibly biological control is most understood for importation of natural opponents, often from the pest's area of origin, to control non-native pests (e.g., importing vedalia bettles to control cottony cushion scales which were attacking California citrus orchards).</p>
<p>There is no clear clinical evidence that taking in crop items stemmed from genetically crafted plants has triggered detrimental impacts to humans or animals (e.g., 75% of all cheeses contain chymosin, which is, and has been for some time, produced with genetically engineered bacteria).
