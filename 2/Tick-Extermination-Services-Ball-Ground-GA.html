<p>Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is a efficient and ecologically delicate  approach to pest management that counts on a mix of common-sense practices. IPM is a technique to ensure economic viability at both customer and manufacturer level (seller is constantly anticipated to earn a profit), environmental safety through a well balanced usage of all readily available pest control options, and social reputation because IPM-based food is economical and safe.</p>
<p>The advantages of Integrated Pest Management are tremendous straight to farming and indirectly to society. Biological control includes the use of living organisms to control a pest population. Do not blend pesticides. There are 4 significant elements in the new IPM design that deal with different pest management options, the knowledge, and resources the grower needs to address the pest problem, preparation and organization of information to take proper management actions, and keeping good communication to obtain and distribute knowledge about pests and their management.</p>
<p>In reference to the concept of incorporating using other and biological controls in complementary ways, the term was later expanded to embrace coordinated usage of all biological, cultural, and synthetic practices (van den Bosch and Stern, 1962). Some natural opponents are inherently more resistant to insecticides than others, and some populations of natural opponents have actually been chosen either naturally or through the efforts of researchers to possess greater levels of resistance. </p>
<p>There are lots of agricultural practices that make the environment less beneficial to insect pests. IPM extended the principle of incorporated control to all classes of pests and was expanded to include all techniques. This chapter discusses different methods to maintain pest insects at bearable levels or simply put incorporated pest management (IPM). Keep kids and animals away from locations where pesticides have been applied.</p>
