<p>The principle of integrated pest management (IPM), a sustainable technique for handling pests, has been in practice for a long period of time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxins are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is also thought about a physical control and, although it does not always kill the insect pests, it a minimum of stops their development and more feeding on the kept crop.</p>
<p>Typical pest like bed bugs, cockroaches, termites, mosquito etc can be so unbearable sometimes that the only option left is to work with a regional pest control company to remove pests. The technician will frequently spray pesticides around the border of numerous spaces if an expert pest control company is under contract to an institution. Hence, integrated pest management suggests that areawide and long-term methods can be valuable.</p>
<p>Beet armyworm larvae intoxicated by sublethal does of MVP (Mycogen, San Diego) (a Bt-derived biopesticide) experience slowed down advancement and feeding and are subject to greater parasitism than nontreated beet armyworm larvae (40 ). To put it simply, a reliable, nondisruptive method to handle a moderate beet armyworm break out might be to retard its development and damage while offering the parasitoids time to work, thus reinforcing the parasitoids' effect during subsequent generations.</p>

A study of vegetable growers in Sri Lanka revealed that almost 50% of them practiced calendar-based chemical pesticide applications before pest or illness event and only 20% had some understanding of IPM (Jayasooriya and Aheeyar 2016 ). A study conducted by Parsa et al. (2014) also showed that an absence of certified IPM professionals and extension teachers was an obstacle for IPM execution in developed countries.</p>

Numerous anti-pesticide NGOs have a far more simplistic definition of IPM - they see IPM as being almost specifically about decreasing pesticide use.
