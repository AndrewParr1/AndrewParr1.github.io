Integrated Pest Management (IPM) was born in the late 1950s out of a crisis in agriculture resulting from an overuse of synthetic pesticides.</p>
<p>There is no clear scientific evidence that consuming crop items stemmed from genetically engineered plants has caused damaging results to animals or humans (e.g., 75% of all cheeses consist of chymosin, which is, and has actually been for some time, produced with genetically crafted germs). In numerous developing countries, where IPM is now governmental policy, pesticide use is being minimized.</p>
<p>Because crop production is extremely exact due to modern-day innovations on one hand, along with highly variable depending upon a myriad of biotic and abiotic factors and the proprietary practices of different farming operations, info management and decision-making parts play a crucial role in IPM. Using IPM to prevent pest problems and lessen reliance on pesticides is the best service for a healthy environment for everyone.</p>
