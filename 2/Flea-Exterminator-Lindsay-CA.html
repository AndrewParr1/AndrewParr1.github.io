<p>4 ). With its success in numerous parts of the world, IPM is deemed a environmentally benign and affordable  pest control method ideally suited for both little and large farmers around the world. Once termites have actually gotten in a structure, they do not limit themselves to wood; they also damage paper, fabric, carpets and more. In some methods, IPM can be viewed as a decision-making procedure in which observations (from evaluation and monitoring) are used to make pest control choices based on pre-determined management goals.</p>
<p>In contrast, organic food production uses a number of the very same concepts as IPM but restricts using pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, as opposed to synthetic chemicals. Other claims consist of reductions in pesticide usage from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into numerous crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into numerous crops to reduce the requirement for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides.</p>
<p>Utilizing natural opponents as an alleviative control is less effective compared to applying them preventively.
