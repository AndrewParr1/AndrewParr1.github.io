In the last few years, pest control has become more technically involved, with licencing and constraints on chemicals," Dr. Siddiqi states.</p>
<p>The concept of incorporated pest management (IPM), a sustainable strategy for managing pests, has been in practice for a very long time. Crops genetically engineered to produce Bt toxic substances are planted in countless hectares worldwide. Cold storage is likewise thought about a physical control and, although it does not necessarily kill the insect pests, it at least stops their development and further feeding on the stored crop.</p>
<p>On the other hand, organic food production applies many of the exact same ideas as IPM however limits the use of pesticides to those that are produced from natural sources, rather than synthetic chemicals. Other claims include reductions in pesticide use from incorporation of genes for Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) into a number of crops to control insect pests and incorporation of resistance to some herbicides into several crops to minimize the need for other, less ecologically favorable, herbicides. </p>
