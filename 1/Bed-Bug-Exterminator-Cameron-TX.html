Integrated Pest Management (IPM) integrates various types of controls-- from hands-on pest removal to standard artificial pesticides-- in a practical, long-term plan. Biopesticides are usually suitable with natural enemies, but there are exceptions.</p>

Applying pesticides to crops, animals, buildings or landscapes on a regular basis, despite need, is not IPM.
