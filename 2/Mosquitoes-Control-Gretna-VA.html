Broadcast spraying of non-specific pesticides is a last hope. Integrated pest management was conceived throughout the 1950s when insecticide resistance, nontarget results, and economic waste were clearly obvious (Stern et al., 1959).</p>
<p>Other pesticides, like surface sprays and termite treatments, remain in the environment for days, weeks and even longer after application. 9 Biological control can be an essential part of an integrated pest management programme.

Animal and Pest Pest Management has surpassed mine and my communities' expectations.</p>
