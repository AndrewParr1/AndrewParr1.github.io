<p>Biological control has actually been effectively used in greenhouses (van Lenteren 1988) and specialty crops such as strawberries grown in the field (Zalom et al. 2018 ). To address intrusive pest concerns, classical biological control approach is normally used where natural opponents from the native region of the invasive pest are imported, multiplied, and released in the brand-new environment of the pest (Kenis et al. 2017, Heimpel and Cock 2018 ). The release of irradiated, sterile insects is another biological control method that has actually been effectively utilized versus a number of pests (Klassen and Curtis 2005 ). </p>
